# Simple-Sotck-Simm
This was a simple stock simmulation I wrote for Prpogrammin II in Java
The idea behind this assignment was giving answers for stock buy/sell.
We would have stocks that were bought at a price, during a specific time. The price for the stocks could increase or decrase, and they could be sold in bulk.
The program needed to correctly calculate gains depending on the prices. 
All stocks from a group (same price) needed to be sold before going to the following one. 

Class block was used to store the stocks bought at a time. This class recorded the price and company name per buying transaciton.
Stock Simmulation was the "brains" of the project handling what to do when action were bought and/or sold
SimmulationRunner was just a tester framework
